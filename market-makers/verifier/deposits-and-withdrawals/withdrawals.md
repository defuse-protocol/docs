# Withdrawals

After having successful [deposits](deposits.md), tokens will be assigned to a user's account in the Verifier contract. The user has complete ownership and control of these tokens. Besides executing trades through intents, the user has the liberty to withdraw their tokens whenever they want.

Given the way tokens are stored in the Verifier smart contract, as explain in the [balances section](balances-and-identifying-your-token.md), there are two ways to withdraw a fungible token from the contract. Same applies to non-fungible tokens, but the difference shall become clear.

1. Using the Verifier smart contract [function call](https://near.github.io/intents/defuse/tokens/nep141/trait.FungibleTokenWithdrawer.html#tymethod.ft_withdraw) `ft_withdraw`, where the token id is used without a prefix (see the [balances section](balances-and-identifying-your-token.md))
2. Using a signed intent, where the token id is also prefixed with `nep141`.

### Examples

1. Assuming Alice has enough balance to cover her wrapped Near withdrawal, she can create a transaction that signs the following withdrawal request using near-cli

```
near contract call-function as-transaction intents.near ft_withdraw json-args '{ "token": "wrap.near", "receiver_id": "alice.near", "amount": "1000" }' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '1 yoctoNEAR' sign-as alice.near network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

2. Using a signed withdraw intent. The following is an example of an intent to withdraw an NEP-141 token:

```json
{
  "standard": "nep413",
  "payload": {
    "message": "{\"signer_id\":\"user1.test.near\",\"deadline\":\"2025-05-20T13:29:34.360380Z\",\"intents\":[{\"intent\":\"ft_withdraw\",\"token\":\"wrap.near\",\"receiver_id\":\"alice.near\",\"amount\":\"1000\"}]}",
    "nonce": "D9JkDUi93utMQZ1hPAOV7gfnzx3fjehp6oNoCQURPe4=",
    "recipient": "defuse.test.near"
  },
  "public_key": "ed25519:Gxa24TGbJu4mqdhW3GbvLXmf4bSEyxVicrtpChDWbgga",
  "signature": "ed25519:52yFEvWpttuFiPwjJR2PdMzBrT34UCH4DX4rtuVeFBdVXt3C4ndA8Xxe7BczHuyC1ACqB24de97oW5U8YUty7omF"
}
```

### Withdrawal of other types of tokens

Just like described above for fungible tokens, NEP-141, the same applies to other types of tokens. All kinds of tokens can be withdrawn either using an intent, or using a native Near blockchain function call. The following is a table with this information summarized

| Token type/standard          | Withdraw function                                                                                                                | Withdraw Intent                                                                                        |

## Refunds on failed withdrawals - Warning

This discussion applies to all withdraw types in the previous section, except for NativeWithdraw, since Near transfers cannot fail.

A refund is the process of restoring the balance of the user when a withdrawal fails at the target smart contract. For example. Say Alice makes a request to withdraw 100 USDC from her Verifier smart contract account. There are two modes of operation for this request, whether it is done through a function call or an intent. Notice the [withdraw function and its signature](https://near.github.io/intents/defuse/tokens/nep141/trait.FungibleTokenWithdrawer.html#tymethod.ft_withdraw). The key parameter in the function for this discussion is `msg`, stemming from the [NEP-141 standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core). Let's discuss the two possible cases:

1. If `msg` is specified, the withdrawal will be done using an `ft_transfer` function call
2. If `msg` is not specified, or `"msg": null` in json, the withdrawal will be done using an `ft_transfer_call` function call

Note: the same applies for Multi Token and NFT transfers mentioned in the table above, with their corresponding `nft_transfer`, `nft_transfer_call`, `mt_transfer`, and `mt_transfer_call`, and the intents, which eventually call these functrions.

Ideally speaking, if Alice does not receive her tokens to the smart contract in question, i.e., if her balance in the USDC smart contract does not increase by the 100 USDC after withdrawing 100 USDC from the Verifier smart contract due to an error in the USDC smart contract, the Verifier should restore the 100 USDC to her balance in the Verifier contract.&#x20;

However, this is not always the case. Due to complexities related to the asynchronous and sharded nature of the Near blockchain, refunds will only be processed when `msg` is unspecified or has a value `null`, i.e., when `ft_transfer` is used for processing the withdrawal.

It is important to emphasize that this refund discussion is exclusively relevant for failures occurring in the target smart contract, not in the Verifier contract itself. If an error happens within the Verifier contract, the balance will not change. But the refund issue happens if an asynchronous call to another smart contract, the USDC smart contract in the above example, leads to an error.

Note that `msg` being empty, i.e., being `""` or an empty string, or being `Some("")` in Rust instead of `None`, still means that `msg` is specified. In the json parameters of your request, make sure you do not specify `msg` at all or specify the value  `null` if you are seeking the behavior of `ft_transfer` and guarantee a refund on failure.

To summarize this in a table:

| Withdrawal request                          | \`msg\` parameter specified | Is a refund possible? |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `FtWithdraw` intent or `ft_withdraw` call   | No (or msg = null)          | Yes                   |
| `FtWithdraw` intent or `ft_withdraw` call   | Yes, as string              | No                    |
| `MtWithdraw` intent or `mt_withdraw` call   | No (or msg = null)          | Yes                   |
| `MtWithdraw` intent or `mt_withdraw` call   | Yes, as string              | No                    |
| `NftWithdraw` intent or `nft_withdraw` call | No (or msg = null)          | Yes                   |
| `NftWithdraw` intent or `nft_withdraw` call | Yes, as string              | No                    |

Hence, to guarantee a withdrawal being successful and a refund, it is recommended to keep `msg` unspecified or is `null`. If you wish to perform any programmable action on the receiving contract, it is recommended to initiate it from an account you own, then doing an `*t_transfer_call` from there.
