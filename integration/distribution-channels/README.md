# Distribution Channels

Distribution channels are applications that have the users who are interested in decentralised spot trading (dapps, wallets, mobile applications, exchanges)

The best way to integrate distribution channel is through [1Click Swap API](1click-api.md).

It works in the following way:

You can request a quote across different chains, and if the user is happy with the offered quote, they send the tokens to an unique deposit address returned by 1Click.

The swap is automatically performed or the tokens are refunded back to the user.





Take a look at [1Click Swap API](1click-api.md) for information on SDKs and usage examples.\
