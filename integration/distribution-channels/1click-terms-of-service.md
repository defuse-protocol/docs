# 1Click Swap API - Terms of Service

**BY ACCESSING, INTEGRATING WITH, OR USING THE 1CLICK SWAP API (“1CS”) YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. 1CS IS A BACKEND ROUTING/SERVICES LAYER DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED BY DEFUSE LABS LIMITED, A COMPANY INCORPORATED IN GIBRALTAR (“DEFUSE”, “WE” and “US”). IT IS SEPARATE FROM THE PROTOCOL, ANY FRONT-END INTERFACES AND THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS (EACH AS DEFINED BELOW). 1CS IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. DEFUSE IS NOT LICENSED OR REGULATED BY ANY FINANCIAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE REGULATED FINANCIAL SERVICES. 1CS IS NOT OFFERED AS, AND IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE, REGULATED FINANCIAL SERVICES. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR USE OF 1CS IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO YOU. BY USING 1CS YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS (SEE SECTION 14), AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. ALL USE OF 1CS IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND DEFUSE ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR YOUR USE OF 1CS EXCEPT TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW.**

***Last updated: October 16th, 2025***

1. **PURPOSE AND SCOPE (WHAT 1CS IS / ISN’T)**

   1. **Purpose.** The 1Click Swap API simplifies interaction with the Protocol. Instead of requiring users or integrators to manually coordinate multiple blockchain steps (for example, bridging assets to NEAR Protocol, posting intents, and withdrawing assets back to other chains), 1CS automates these routing and settlement steps. The goal is a simplified, “one-click” user experience for complex cross-chain transactions.

   2. **How it works.** When called, 1CS takes high-level instructions (intents) and performs the technical steps needed to fulfil them, including interacting with independent third-party components (e.g., bridges, relayers). 1CS orchestrates these processes; it does not provide liquidity, investment advice, or exchange services. Further details of how 1CS works can be found at [https://docs.near-intents.org/near-intents/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api](https://docs.near-intents.org/near-intents/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api). 

   3. **What it isn’t.** 1CS is not intended to operate as a wallet, broker, advisor, exchange, payment service provider, money transmitter or fiduciary. It does not operate liquidity pools, order books, yield-generating protocols or trading venues. 1CS does not pool user funds, act as counterparty or provide financial guarantees, insurance or underwritten. All transactions facilitated through 1CS are executed by users through the underlying smart contract, and 1CS bears no responsibility for verifying the legality, suitability or taxation of any user activity. 

   4. **Separation.** 1CS is separate from the Protocol, any Front-End Interfaces and any Third-Party Components. Those components are developed and maintained by third parties, and have their own terms and documentation.

2. **DEFINITIONS**

   1. **“1Click Swap API” or “1CS”:** the backend/API service developed and maintained by Defuse to assist with routing and settlement of intents via the Protocol, as described above.

   2. **“Protocol” or “Intents Protocol”:** the smart contracts deployed on the NEAR Protocol (including, without limitation, the intents.near contract) that enable users to post, match, and settle intents. The Protocol is not operated or controlled by Defuse and is distinct from both 1CS and any Front-End Interfaces.

   3. **“Front-End Interface”:** any website or application that provides user-facing access to the Protocol or 1CS.

   4. **“Third-Party Components”:** independent services, applications or protocols that 1CS may interface with (which may include, for example, OmniBridge, HOT Bridge, or the PoA Bridge), other than services, applications or protocols developed, maintained, or operated by Defuse.

   5. **“Integrator”:** any developer or entity that connects or integrates its product, protocol, service, or Front-End Interface to 1CS.

3. **DEVELOPER/MAINTAINER**

   1CS is developed and maintained by Defuse. Defuse maintains the infrastructure necessary to operate 1CS.  Defuse does not operate the Protocol, any Third-Party Components, or any Front-End Interfaces.

4. **TECHNICAL ACTIONS**

   1. To perform routing and settlement, in the ordinary course of operation, 1CS may carry out limited technical actions relating to user assets solely to effect user-authorized transactions. These actions:

      1) are incidental and/or necessary to construct and submit transactions (including via Third-Party Components);

      2) are limited to executing user-approved instructions;

      3) are transient, programmatic, and self-executing, and take no longer than necessary to complete the transaction;

      4) do not involve pooling, rehypothecation, or re-use of user assets; 

      5) do not create any fiduciary, agency, or safekeeping relationship with users; and

      6) do not at any time give Defuse or any affiliated entity beneficial ownership of user assets.

   2. You remain responsible for your wallet, approvals, and on-chain actions.

5. **THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS**

   1CS interacts with independent Third-Party Components (e.g., bridges, relayers), and is accessible via Front-End Interfaces. These are not developed, maintained, or operated by Defuse and are subject to their own terms, risks, and availability. Defuse is not responsible for the performance, security, governance, downtime, or failures of Third-Party Components or Front-End Interfaces (or their respective operators).

   

6. **ELIGIBILITY AND PROHIBITED LOCALITIES**

   1. 1CS is not intended for use by persons or entities located in, established in, or resident of the following jurisdictions (or any other jurisdiction on applicable sanctions lists). Do not use 1CS if this applies to you: Afghanistan (under Taliban control), Belarus, Central African Republic, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Mali, Myanmar (Burma), Nicaragua, North Korea (DPRK), Russia (including the Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions of Ukraine), Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela (including certain SDNs connected with the Maduro regime), Yemen, or Zimbabwe.

   2. You must not use 1CS if you are on, or controlled by a party on, any U.S, EU, UK, or UN sanctions list. You must not use any technology (including VPNs) to circumvent these restrictions.

   3. If you are a UK resident, you agree and acknowledge that 1CS is provided as a tool for users to interact with the Protocol on their own initiative, with no endorsement or recommendation of cryptocurrency trading activities. In doing so, Defuse is not recommending that users or potential users engage in cryptoasset trading activity, and users or potential users of 1CS should not regard 1CS as involving any form of recommendation, invitation or inducement to deal in cryptoassets.

7. **REGULATORY STATUS AND YOUR COMPLIANCE**

   1. Defuse is not licensed or regulated by any financial regulatory authority to provide regulated financial services, and 1CS is not offered as, and is not intended to constitute, regulated financial services.

   2. It is your responsibility to determine whether your use of 1CS is permitted under the laws and regulations that apply to you.

   3. We make no representations regarding how any authority may characterize 1CS or related activities under applicable laws or regulations. You bear the risk that authorities may take positions inconsistent with our view, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive, release, and covenant not to sue the Defuse or any of its affiliates for any and all claims, losses or liabilities arising from or related to such positions or actions.

   4. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of 1CS complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you (including sanctions, AML/CFT, consumer, tax, and securities/derivatives rules or any other applicable law or regulation).

   5. If you access 1CS through a Front-End Interface, you may also be subject to that Front-End Interface’s terms of service. Your use of Third-Party Components or Front-End Interfaces are subject to the applicable terms of service, privacy policies, and legal notices of each third-party provider, and you are responsible for reviewing and complying with them. Defuse shall have no liability for any losses, damages, or claims arising from or related to third-party services, integrations, or external dependencies used in connection with 1CS.

8. ### **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

   1. All rights, title, and interest in and to the 1CS, including its software, source code (except to the extent any component is expressly released under an open-source license), infrastructure, documentation, and related materials, are and shall remain the exclusive property of Defuse or (if applicable) its licensors. Except as expressly permitted by these Terms, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise exploit any part of 1CS. References to the Protocol or to Third-Party Components are for descriptive purposes only and do not imply any sponsorship, endorsement, or ownership by Defuse. All third-party trademarks, service marks, logos, or brand names are the property of their respective owners.

9. **RISKS, NO WARRANTIES, AND NO SERVICE LEVELS**

   1. 1CS is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” ALL USE OF 1CS IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Defuse disclaims all warranties (express, implied, or statutory), including as to security, availability, correctness, fitness for purpose, non-infringement, or error-free/continuous operation.

   2. 1CS is experimental infrastructure and may be interrupted, suspended, or modified at any time. Defuse does not guarantee, and Defuse shall have no liability in respect of, availability, uptime, continuity, or error-free operation of 1CS, nor does it undertake to provide maintenance, support, or any service-level commitments of any kind.

   3. On-chain activity carries risks (e.g., smart-contract bugs, bridge exploits, slippage, MEV, reorgs, network congestion, loss of keys). Transactions may be final and irreversible. Only interact if you understand and accept these risks.

10. **FEES AND EXECUTION**

    You are responsible for all fees associated with your use of 1CS, including network (“gas”) fees, bridge fees, protocol fees, and other execution costs. Fees may apply even if a transaction fails or is reverted. Execution results may differ from estimates due to market conditions and slippage. 1CS does not guarantee pricing or execution.

11. **INTEGRATORS (ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES)**

    If you integrate 1CS into a product or interface, you:

    1. must present clear, prominent disclosures to your users consistent with these Terms (especially Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12);

    2. are responsible for sanctions compliance and user eligibility;

    3. must not misrepresent 1CS or imply it is operated by you or by any Front-End Interface; and

    4. must implement reasonable safeguards to prevent abusive, illegal, or sanction-circumventing use.

12. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

    1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DEFUSE, DEFUSE’S AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, DIGITAL ASSETS, OR OPPORTUNITY, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO 1CS OR THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

    2. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR FRAUD, WILFUL MISCONDUCT, OR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE). SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, DEFUSE’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED USD 100 (ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS).

13. **INDEMNITY**

    1. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Defuse, Defuse’s affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents (together, the “**Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to:

       1) your access to or use of 1CS;

       2) your breach of these Terms;

       3) your violation of any law or regulation applicable to you;

       4) your violation of any rights of a third party (including intellectual property, privacy, or contractual rights); or

       5) if you are an Integrator, any claim, demand, or proceeding brought by an end user of your product, service, or Front-End Interface that integrates with 1CS.

    2. The Indemnified Parties may, at their sole discretion, assume the defence and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You agree to cooperate with any such defence.

14. **GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES**

    These Terms are governed by the laws of Gibraltar. The courts of Gibraltar will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or 1CS. At our sole discretion, we may require you to submit any dispute to final and binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the Gibraltar Arbitration Act of 1895 (as amended or replaced). ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE WAIVED.

15. **CHANGES, SUSPENSION, TERMINATION**

    We may suspend or modify 1CS (in whole or part) or terminate your access at any time for operational, security, legal, or sanctions-compliance reasons. We may update these Terms at any time by posting an updated version in the official 1CS repository or documentation. Your continued use after an update means you accept the revised Terms.

16. **DATA**

    1CS does not request, store, or have access to, private keys. We may process limited operational metadata (e.g., logs and diagnostics) to run and improve the service and to address abuse, security, or legal compliance. On-chain activity is public by design.

    

    

17. **MISCELLANEOUS**

    If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remaining provisions will continue in full force. These Terms constitute the entire agreement regarding your use of 1CS and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understandings on this subject. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to create any partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between you and Defuse.
